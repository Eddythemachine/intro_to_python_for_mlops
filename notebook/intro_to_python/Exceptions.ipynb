    "# Exceptions in Python¶\n",
    "When you encounter exceptions in Python you might be tempted to catch them to ignore. This is almost always not a sounds strategy. The rule of thumb is to catch exceptions that you are going to handle. If you can't handle an exception it is a better idea to let that exception get raised and break the program.\n",
